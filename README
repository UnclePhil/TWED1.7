TiddlyWikiEsxDoc
A vmware infrastructure documenter with tiddlywiki file as result
=====================================================================
VERSION 1.7 2009/10/29

What's new
----------
+Bug correction
+Post processing command; to post the file somwhere 

Prerequisite
------------
Poweshell V2 ONLY
Due to the inclusion of the config file, be sure to use a powershell V2 

Remark
------
If you try to use my script, adapt the TWEDConfig.ps1 file to your needs
The program is only a documenter so you can set a read-only user in the config file

The script will automatically create a report subdirectory where he put his final report

And for the rest, you and you only are responsible of the usage of this program in a production infrastructure.
But in my case i use it every day to create a snapview of my environment

In my case for 11 Esx server, 3 cluster , and 260 VM the script run during aproximately 1hour
If you don't want wait , you can set the $vmlimit counter in the config file

If you have more than one environment, you can use the program with multiple configfile give the configFilename as parameter


Have fun
